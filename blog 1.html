      <p>LFriday 8/12 What makes video games so enticing and entertaining? word count: 70&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I think that the drive to succeed and win in a video game is what makes it so entertaining. You always have an end goal to achieve something, whether that be winning against another team, or reaching another level. The point of most video games is to succeed in whatever task the game has you doing, and the want to keep improving makes video games have extremely high replay value. Why do people like games? Article. This article highlights the psychology behind why people like games. It claims that factors like the story of the game, graphics, controls, or social environment surrounding a game all play a part into why people enjoy gaming so much.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Tuesday 8/16 Why are video games and games in general so powerful a factor in society? I think video games are so powerful in society because of the replay value. Video games are almost never just a “one and done”, where you play it once, or a few times tto finish it, and never touch it again. They hold a large part in society as a topic of social groups where fans of a game can discuss and play together. Video games are just as a part of everyday life compared to something like going to school for some.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Thursday 8/18 Why that game? What makes that game fun to play? What genre does it belong to? What makes it unique or more fun to play than other games in the same genre? I played Stumble Guys. I chose it because its a quick time passing game.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Monday 8/22 Describe your gaming location. Where do you usually game? My gaming location is my living room, right by the front door. It was originally in my bedroom, but it was moved into the living room for space. Its a wood desk I built myself that holds my pc and my monitor.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Thursday 9/1 What conclusions can you draw from these statistics? I can draw the conclusion that the way people use social media is how their perception of it is. I think that the people who rate it positively use social media mainly for different reasons than the people that had rated it negatively. What are the key takeaways from the video? I think the key takeaways are that active use is better than passive use on social media. Actually being involved in the social media instead of just reading news and looking at phones led to more positive moods. How do they compare to your personal experience? In my personal experience I think of social media positively, as it is the main way I can connect and talk with my friends.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Tuesday 9/6 What game will you pick for the coaching project? I will pick Fortnite for the coaching project. I chose Fortnite because of my prior competitive experience. I already know alot about the mechanics, techniques, and strategies of competitive Fortnite.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Thursday 9/29 What does it take to be a good coach in esports? To be a good coach in esports, it takes patience, understanding of the game at a high level, and being able to communicate to people well. I think I am good at the understanding part of coaching, and I think I can work on communicating effectively and efficiently. </p>
